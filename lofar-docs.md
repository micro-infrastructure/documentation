## LOBCDER LOFAR adaptors
There are two LOFAR adaptors that can be used to move data from the LOFAR LTA to an HPC cluster. Visit their respective repositories for instructions:

- [adaptor-lofar-stage](https://github.com/micro-infrastructure/adaptor-lofar-stage)
- [adaptor-lofar-download](https://github.com/micro-infrastructure/adaptor-lofar-download)

To deploy these services as part of mini-lobcder, see the [lofar template](https://github.com/micro-infrastructure/mini-lobcder/blob/master/k8s-setup/user-infra.json.template-lofar).
